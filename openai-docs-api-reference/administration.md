# Administration

Programmatically manage your organization.
The Audit Logs endpoint provides a log of all actions taken in the organization for security and monitoring purposes.
To access these endpoints please generate an Admin API Key through the [API Platform Organization overview](/organization/admin-keys). Admin API keys cannot be used for non-administration endpoints.
For best practices on setting up your organization, please refer to this [guide](/docs/guides/production-best-practices#setting-up-your-organization)
