# Usage

The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.

While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs tab](/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will reconcile back to your billing invoice.
