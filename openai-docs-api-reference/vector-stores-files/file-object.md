## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Allowed Values | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Yes |  |  | The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints. |
| `object` | string | Yes |  | `vector_store.file` | The object type, which is always `vector_store.file`. |
| `usage_bytes` | integer | Yes |  |  | The total vector store usage in bytes. Note that this may be different from the original file size. |
| `created_at` | integer | Yes |  |  | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the vector store file was created. |
| `vector_store_id` | string | Yes |  |  | The ID of the [vector store](/docs/api-reference/vector-stores/object) that the [File](/docs/api-reference/files) is attached to. |
| `status` | string | Yes |  | `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `failed` | The status of the vector store file, which can be either `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, or `failed`. The status `completed` indicates that the vector store file is ready for use. |
