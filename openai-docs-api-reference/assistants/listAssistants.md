# List assistants

`GET` `/assistants`

Returns a list of assistants.

## Parameters

### Query Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| `limit` | integer | No | A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 20. <br>  |
| `order` | string | No | Sort order by the `created_at` timestamp of the objects. `asc` for ascending order and `desc` for descending order. <br>  |
| `after` | string | No | A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list. <br>  |
| `before` | string | No | A cursor for use in pagination. `before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list. <br>  |

| `has_more` | boolean | Yes |  |  |  |


### Items in `data` array

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Allowed Values | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `id` | string | Yes |  |  | The identifier, which can be referenced in API endpoints. |
| `object` | string | Yes |  | `assistant` | The object type, which is always `assistant`. |
| `created_at` | integer | Yes |  |  | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the assistant was created. |
| `name` | string | Yes |  |  | The name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters. <br>  |
| `description` | string | Yes |  |  | The description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters. <br>  |
| `model` | string | Yes |  |  | ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models) for descriptions of them. <br>  |
| `instructions` | string | Yes |  |  | The system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 256,000 characters. <br>  |
| `tools` | array of oneOf: object (1 property) | object (2 properties) | object (2 properties) | Yes | `[]` |  | A list of tool enabled on the assistant. There can be a maximum of 128 tools per assistant. Tools can be of types `code_interpreter`, `file_search`, or `function`. <br>  |
| `tool_resources` | object (2 properties) | No |  |  | A set of resources that are used by the assistant's tools. The resources are specific to the type of tool. For example, the `code_interpreter` tool requires a list of file IDs, while the `file_search` tool requires a list of vector store IDs. <br>  |
| `metadata` | map | Yes |  |  | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be <br> useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured <br> format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.  <br>  <br> Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings <br> with a maximum length of 512 characters. <br>  |
|   ↳ (additional properties) | string | - | - | - | Additional properties of this object |
| `temperature` | number | No | `1` |  | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. <br>  |
| `top_p` | number | No | `1` |  | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. <br>  <br> We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. <br>  |
| `response_format` | oneOf: string | object (1 property) | object (1 property) | object (2 properties) | No |  |  | Specifies the format that the model must output. Compatible with [GPT-4o](/docs/models#gpt-4o), [GPT-4 Turbo](/docs/models#gpt-4-turbo-and-gpt-4), and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models since `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106`. <br>  <br> Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs). <br>  <br> Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. <br>  <br> **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length. <br>  |
